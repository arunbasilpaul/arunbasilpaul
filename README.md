# WELCOME!!!
## Hi, I'm Arun ðŸ‘‹ #

I'm an Mechatronics Graduate from the University of Siegen who is passionate about creating safety-critical embedded systems, saving and bettering lives accessible to everyone. My projects have been built around this belief. I enjoy working with Vivado, Vitis, OS, Hardware acceleration, programming (Verilog, VHDL, C, C++, Python) and Machine Learning. I have completed projects funded by the Governement of India to find a new approach to traditional painting using drones. In my time at the University of Siegen, I developed an interest to FPGAs and have focused in developing solutions for medical devices such as a hardware OS for the TE0802 Zynq Ultrascale+, custom IPs for Hardware acceleration and pre-fetching. I have been working with FPGAs for two years and counting.....
