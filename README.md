I'm a Mechatronics Graduate from UniversitÃ¤t Siegen who is passionate about creating safety-critical embedded systems, saving and bettering lives accessible to everyone. I enjoy working with Vivado, Vitis, OS, Hardware acceleration, programming (Verilog, VHDL, C, C++, Python) and Machine Learning. I have completed projects funded by the Govt. of India to find a new approach to traditional painting using drones. In my time at UniversitÃ¤t Siegen, I developed an interest to FPGAs and have focused in developing solutions for medical devices such as a hardware OS for the TE0802 Zynq Ultrascale+, custom IPs for Hardware acceleration, memory allocation pattern recognition and pre-fetching for the past two years and counting..... </div>
